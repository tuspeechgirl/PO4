			<p>Squirrel Appreciation Day is observed annually on January 21. The creator, Christy Hargrove,
				 is a wildlife rehabilitator in North Carolina and is affiliated with the Western North Carolina
				  Nature Center.  According to Christy, “Celebration of the event itself is up to the individual or
					group — anything from putting out extra food for the squirrels to learning something new about the
					 species.”</p>

					 <p>According to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System of North America (ITIS), there
						  are over 200 species of squirrels.  Some of the oldest squirrels categorized on the list
							 are the nocturnal arrow flying squirrel (validated in 1766) and the Black Giant
							 (validated in 1778).  Of all these species, they fall into three types.
							 Ground squirrels, such as the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, the rock squirrel,
							  California ground squirrel and many others blanket the prairies and deserts of North
								 America. Often causing damage, they can be considered pests, and they are labeled rodents.
								  Predators enjoy them as a tasty morsel, too. As a result, they work together to protect
									themselves. Their only protection is to flee!
									Tree squirrels make their homes in the trees but also find their nesting
									 materials and food both on the ground and above. Making their homes in cities
									  and the countryside in nations all around the globe, these familiar backyard and
										park residents will make themselves right at home in your birdfeeders or snag your
										 snack right from your hands if they have become practiced enough! The third type of
										 squirrel leaps farther than the others with flaps of skin between the legs. Flying
										  squirrels glide greater distances giving the impression they can fly. When they leap
											 from tree to tree or building to building, they spread their legs wide and float on
											  the breeze escaping predators or perhaps other snarky tree squirrels with a nut to
												 pick with them.</p>
