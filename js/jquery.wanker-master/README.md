jquery.wanker.js
================

Responsive design has been a blessing to web crafters everywhere. The web, however, was meant to be read, not squished. **jquery.wanker.js** is a tiny (*549 bytes minified*) jQuery plugin that reveals a public service announcement when people start excessively resizing their desktop browser as they try to see your responsive breakpoints.

**jquery.wanker.js** is the perfect easter egg plugin for designers, photographers, writers, and other creative [people with a sense of humor](https://github.com/migreyes/jquery.wanker/wiki/Design-Gallery) displaying their work on the web wishing their viewers to focus more on their work, and less on the magic of media queries.

## Installing jquery.wanker.js
Assuming youâ€™re already using jQuery, include the file in your `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  <script src="jquery.wanker.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

## Design your public service announcement

```html
<div class="wanker" data-wanker>
  <div class="wanker-content">
    <h1>The web was meant to be read, not squished.</h1>
    <p>Prevent excessive browser resizing and get people back to reading.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Call the wanker() function on your design

```javascript
$(function() {
  $('[data-wanker]').wanker();
});
```

The message will show up after 1 second of continuous browser resizing, and will disappear 1.5 seconds later. Prefer to choose your own delay and duration? No problem!

```javascript
$(function() {
  $('[data-wanker]').wanker({delay: 5000, duration: 5000});
});
```
