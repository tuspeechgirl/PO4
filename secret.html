					What Do Squirrels Do When Your Not Watching


				<img src="images/book.jpg"></h1>
		</div>
		<div class="book-info">
			<p>Ever wonder what squirrels do when they’re not scurrying through yards
				 and scampering up trees? Nancy Rose offered some creative insight in
				 The Secret Life of Squirrels, which spotlights squirrel visitors to her
				  backyard deck in Bedford, Nova Scotia. Published by Little, Brown/Tingley in 2014,
					 the picture book features photographs of red squirrels in miniature sets Rose creates
					  using cardboard, clay, craft supplies, and dollar store finds. Rose then snapped her
						rodent pals celebrating the holidays for 2015’s Merry Christmas, Squirrels!, and now
						captures them courting in The Secret Life of Squirrels: A Love Story, due out this month.</p>
						<img class="acorn" src="images/acorn.png">
				<p>Photographer Rose’s photographs of squirrels interacting with miniature props
					 of her own making earned her a following on the photo website Flickr. Now,
					 she crafts a picture-book narrative around several such photos, introducing
					 Mr. Peanuts, a “rather unusual squirrel” who is seen tending to a miniature
					 gas grill, playing a tiny piano (“His favorite piece is Moonlight Sonata.
					 Most squirrels would find that piece quite difficult to play”), reading, and
					  tidying up before the arrival of Cousin Squirrel. Images of twigs frame several
						photos, which show Mr. Peanuts and his cousin “playing” chess, dining at a
						 picnic table (with a cocktail umbrella for shade), and enjoying a
						  cake topped with acorns. “[Squirrels] will inspect and explore
							 anything if peanuts are involved,” Rose says in a q&a at book’s
							  end, explaining how she has created a photo studio for her
								miniature scenes off her house’s deck. The storyline is little
								 more than a vehicle to showcase Rose’s photos, but those images
								 should pique the interest of casual readers and prospective photographers,
								 who can try the wildlife photography tips she offers. Ages 3–6.</p>
